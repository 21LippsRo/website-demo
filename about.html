                <h2>ABOUT ROBERT LIPPS</h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Robert Lipps was born and raised in the Butler and Warren County area. A graduate of Franklin High
                    School and the Warren County Career Center (WCCC), Robert dedicated much of his high school years to
                    advocating for Conservative campaigns and vocational education across Warren County. As a
                    co-valedictorian of his WCCC class, he held several leadership positions, including serving on the
                    Middletown Community Foundation Youth Council, the Ohio Attorney General's Youth Advisory Board, and
                    as Vice President of SkillsUSA Ohio's State Board.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Post-graduation, Robert has continued his education while advocating for his core values. Following
                    in his father's footsteps, he is pursuing a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at Wright
                    State University and has already earned three associate degrees from Sinclair Community College.
                    Despite his young age, Robert has volunteered countless hours to various campaigns across the
                    South-West Ohio region, including campaigns for State Representative, U.S. Senate, State Central
                    Committee, WCCC issues, and City Council. Currently, Robert serves as the City of Franklin's
                    Representative to the Warren County Board of Health.
